# Issue Summary
I had isssues with the load balancer and my servers at some point in the course of the program. I battled with it for a while, i can't relly remember the time frame though.

## Attempted Solution
I had to read a lot of resources both the ones provided by ALX and the one i got outside ALX and i was able to solve my problem.
